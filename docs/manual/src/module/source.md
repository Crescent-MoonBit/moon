# Source directory

The `source` field is used to specify the source directory of the module.

It must be a subdirectory of the directory where the `moon.mod.json` file is located and must be a relative path.

When creating a module using the `moon new` command, a `src` directory will be automatically generated, and the default value of the `source` field will be `src`.

```json
{
  "source": "src"
}
```

When the `source` field does not exist, or its value is `null` or an empty string `""`, it is equivalent to setting `"source": "."`. This means that the source directory is the same as the directory where the `moon.mod.json` file is located.

```json
{
  "source": null
}
{
  "source": ""
}
{
  "source": "."
}
```
