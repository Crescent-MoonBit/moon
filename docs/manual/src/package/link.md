# Link Options

By default, moon only links packages where `is-main` is set to `true`. If you need to link other packages, you can specify this with the `link` option.

The `link` option is used to specify link options, and its value can be either a boolean or an object.

- When the `link` value is `true`, it indicates that the package should be linked. The output will vary depending on the backend specified during the build.

  ```json
  {
    "link": true
  }
  ```

- When the `link` value is an object, it indicates that the package should be linked, and you can specify link options. For detailed configuration, please refer to the subpage for the corresponding backend.
